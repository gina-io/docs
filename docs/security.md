# Security & CVE compliance

This page lists the known HTTP/2 vulnerabilities and the mitigations applied by Gina.
All remediations are in effect by default — no configuration is required.

:::info Node.js version requirement
Several OS-level fixes require **Node.js ≥ 20.12.1** (or ≥ 21.7.1 for the v21 line).
Run `node -v` to confirm. If you are below this version, upgrade before deploying
Gina on a public HTTP/2 endpoint.

## CVE-2023-44487 — HTTP/2 Rapid Reset

**Attack:** A client opens a stream and immediately sends `RST_STREAM`, cancelling it
before the server finishes processing. By repeating this at high speed (thousands of
streams per second), an attacker can exhaust server resources with zero bandwidth — a
highly asymmetric denial-of-service.

**Gina mitigation (`core/server.isaac.js`):**

```js
http2Options.maxSessionRejectedStreams = 100;
```

When a session exceeds 100 rejected streams, Node.js closes it with a `GOAWAY` frame.
This caps the amplification factor per TCP connection.

Gina adds a second, application-level layer: a per-session rolling-one-second-window
stream counter. When a connection opens more than `maxStreamsPerSecond` new streams
(default 200) within one window, Gina sends a `GOAWAY` and closes that session
itself — catching created-then-reset floods that `maxSessionRejectedStreams` (which
counts *refused* streams) does not. The `/_gina/info` endpoint reports a
`rapidResetBlocked` counter for breach events.

**OS-level fix:** Node.js ≥ 20.12.1 includes the upstream `nghttp2` patch that rate-limits
stream resets at the HTTP/2 framing layer. All three layers are required for full protection.

---

## CVE-2024-27316 / CVE-2024-27983 — CONTINUATION flood

**Attack:** An HTTP/2 `HEADERS` frame can be followed by an unlimited sequence of
`CONTINUATION` frames before the end-of-headers flag is set. Sending a very long chain
forces the server to buffer and parse all frames before it can reject the request,
exhausting CPU and memory.

**Gina mitigation (`core/server.isaac.js`):**

```js
http2Options.maxSessionInvalidFrames = 1000;
```

A session that sends more than 1000 frames that fail validation (including malformed
CONTINUATION chains) is closed immediately. Node.js ≥ 20.12.1 additionally rejects
oversized CONTINUATION sequences at the protocol level (CVE-2024-27983 fix).

---

## CVE-2019-9514 — RST flood

**Attack:** A client sends a large number of `RST_STREAM` frames against server-initiated
streams, forcing the server to perform stream state bookkeeping for each one.

**Gina mitigation (`core/server.isaac.js`):**

```js
http2Options.maxSessionRejectedStreams = 100;
```

Same setting as Rapid Reset — once a session reaches the limit, it is closed with
`GOAWAY`. This bounds the per-connection amplification factor to 100 rejected streams.

---

## HPACK bomb

**Attack:** A compressed HTTP/2 header block can expand to a much larger uncompressed
size due to HPACK's Huffman coding and dynamic table references. An attacker can craft a
small compressed payload that forces the server to allocate megabytes of memory while
parsing headers.

**Gina mitigation (`core/server.isaac.js`):**

```js
http2Options.settings = {
    maxHeaderListSize : 65536   // 64 KB compressed header cap
  , ...
};
```

`maxHeaderListSize` is sent to the client in the HTTP/2 `SETTINGS` frame. Compliant
clients will not send header blocks larger than this value. Non-compliant clients that
exceed the limit receive a `COMPRESSION_ERROR` stream error.

---

## Server push disabled

HTTP/2 server push was deprecated in Chrome 106 (October 2022) and removed in Firefox 132.
The RFC 9113 revision also relaxes the requirement. Gina disables it unconditionally:

```js
http2Options.settings = {
    enablePush : false
  , ...
};
```

This eliminates an entire attack surface (push cache poisoning, resource amplification)
at zero cost to legitimate use cases.

---

## Static-asset path traversal (fixed in 0.5.7)

**Attack:** a request URL containing `../` — or its percent-encoded forms (`%2F`, `%2e%2e`) —
escaped a `statics.json` mapping's target directory and read sibling files under the shared
root (configuration, credentials, server-side source).

**Mitigation:** upgrade to `0.5.7` or later. Both static resolvers canonicalise the resolved
path and confine it to the mapping target (or `publicPath`); any escape returns **404**.
Legitimate assets are served unchanged and no configuration change is required.

---

## Configuring HTTP/2 security limits

The stream, window, and flood-defense limits are tunable in your bundle's
`settings.server.json` under `http2Options` — they ship as conservative defaults, so
override them only when you have a specific reason. The hardcoded security guards
(`maxHeaderListSize`, `enablePush: false`) are not configurable by design.

```json
{
  "server": {
    "http2Options": {
      "maxConcurrentStreams": 256,
      "initialWindowSize": 655350,
      "maxSessionRejectedStreams": 100,
      "maxSessionInvalidFrames": 1000,
      "maxStreamsPerSecond": 200
    }
  }
}
```

See the [Configuration reference](/reference/settings) for the full `settings.server.json`
field list.

## Checking your Node.js version

```bash
node -v
# Should be v20.12.1 or higher
```

If you are on an older release, upgrade via [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) or your
system package manager before exposing an HTTP/2 endpoint to the internet.

If you discover a security issue in Gina, please report it privately via
[GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/gina-io/gina/security/advisories/new)
rather than opening a public issue. We aim to respond within 72 hours.
