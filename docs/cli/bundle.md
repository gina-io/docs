# `gina bundle`

Manage individual bundles within a project. Bundles are independent Node.js processes, and these commands let you start, stop, restart, build, scaffold, and list them. All commands require `@<project>` to identify the target project.

---

## `bundle:start`

Start a bundle as a background process.

```bash
gina bundle:start <bundle> @<project>
```

```bash
gina bundle:start frontend @myproject
```

The bundle's entry point (`src/<bundle>/index.js`) is executed in a detached
child process. The assigned port is printed to stdout on success.

**Flags**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--env=<env>` | Override the project's default environment (`dev`, `prod`, or a custom env) |
| `--scope=<scope>` | Override the project's default scope |
| `--gina-version=<version>` | Pin this bundle to a specific installed gina version (see below) |

Any unrecognised `--key=value` flag is forwarded to the Node.js process
(e.g. `--max-old-space-size=4096`, `--inspect=5858`, `--inspect-brk=5858`).

**Debugging**

```bash
gina bundle:start api @myproject --inspect-brk=5858 --max-old-space-size=2048
```

**Per-bundle framework version**

Pin a bundle to a specific installed gina version without touching the running
socket server:

```bash
gina bundle:start api @myproject --gina-version=0.1.8
```

You can also declare the version statically in `manifest.json` so it applies on
every start without a CLI flag:

```json
{
  "bundles": {
    "api": {
      "gina_version": "0.1.8"
    }
  }
}
```

The CLI flag takes priority over `manifest.json`. The declared version is
validated against the tracked version list in `~/.gina/main.json` — only
versions that were properly installed are accepted. The socket server continues
running its own version; only the spawned bundle process uses the declared
version.

---

## `bundle:stop`

Stop a running bundle.

```bash
gina bundle:stop <bundle> @<project>
```

```bash
gina bundle:stop frontend @myproject
```

---

## `bundle:restart`

Stop then start a bundle. Equivalent to running `bundle:stop` followed by
`bundle:start`.

```bash
gina bundle:restart <bundle> @<project>
```

```bash
gina bundle:restart api @myproject
```

---

## `bundle:status`

Print the current status of a bundle (running / stopped, PID, port).

```bash
gina bundle:status <bundle> @<project>
```

---

## `bundle:build`

Build a bundle for distribution. Compiles assets, applies environment overrides,
and writes a release to `releases/`.

```bash
gina bundle:build <bundle> @<project> [--env=<env>] [--scope=<scope>]
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--env` | `dev` | Target environment (`dev`, `prod`, or a custom env) |
| `--scope` | `local` | Target scope (`local`, `production`, or a custom scope) |

```bash
gina bundle:build frontend @myproject --env=prod --scope=local
```

---

## `bundle:add`

Scaffold a new bundle inside an existing project. Creates the standard directory
structure under `src/<bundle>/` and registers the bundle in `manifest.json`.

```bash
gina bundle:add <bundle> @<project>
```

```bash
gina bundle:add admin @myproject
```

The new bundle entry in `manifest.json` is written with the current framework
version pinned as `gina_version` so the pin is explicit from day one:

```jsonc title="manifest.json (after bundle:add admin)"
{
  "bundles": {
    "admin": {
      "version":      "0.0.1",
      "gina_version": "0.3.0-alpha.1",   // written automatically
      "src":          "src/admin",
      "link":         "bundles/admin"
    }
  }
}
```

To run the bundle under a different installed version, edit `gina_version`
manually or use `--gina-version` at start time. See
[Per-bundle framework version](#per-bundle-framework-version) below.

---

## `bundle:remove`

Remove a bundle from a project. Unregisters it from `manifest.json`.

```bash
gina bundle:remove <bundle> @<project>
```

---

## `bundle:list`

List all bundles registered in a project.

```bash
gina bundle:list @<project>
```
