# Configuration Reference

Every bundle in a Gina project is configured through a set of JSON files in its `config/` directory. There is no configuration in code — routing, server settings, templates, and database connections are all declared in these files. This page lists every config file, explains the naming convention and environment overlay system, and documents the path template variables available inside config values.

```
src/
└── <bundle>/
    └── config/
        ├── app.json
        ├── routing.json
        ├── settings.json
        ├── settings.server.json
        ├── settings.server.credentials.json
        ├── statics.json
        ├── templates.json
        ├── connectors.json
        ├── security.json
        └── watchers.json
```

## Config files at a glance

| File | Required | Purpose |
|---|:---:|---|
| [`app.json`](./app) | ✓ | Bundle identity, proxy connections, app-level constants |
| [`routing.json`](./routing) | ✓ | URL → controller action mapping |
| [`settings.json`](./settings) | ✓ | Server engine, protocol, locale, uploads |
| [`settings.server.json`](./settings#settingsserverjson) | — | Webroot, CORS — server-side-only overrides |
| [`settings.server.credentials.json`](./settings#settingsservercredentialsjson) | — | TLS certificate and private key paths |
| [`settings.server.cache.${env}.json`](./settings#settingsservercacheenvjson) | — | Cache on/off per environment |
| [`settings.server.resolvers.json`](./settings#settingsserverresolversjson) | — | DNS resolvers per scope |
| [`statics.json`](./statics) | — | URL path → filesystem path aliases |
| [`templates.json`](./templates) | — | Page template definitions (stylesheets, scripts, layouts) |
| [`connectors.json`](./connectors) | — | Database connector configuration |
| [`security.json`](./security) | — | Session expiry overrides |
| [`watchers.json`](./watchers) | — | File watchers — event-driven change detection, no polling |

## Naming convention

Config filenames follow a structured pattern:

```
settings.<section>.<env>.json
```

- **`<section>`** — dot-separated path that determines where the content is merged in the
  final config tree. `settings.server.json` is merged under the `server` key.
  `settings.server.credentials.json` is merged under `server.credentials`.
- **`<env>`** — optional environment suffix (`dev`, `prod`, `beta` …). The file only has
  effect when the active `NODE_ENV` matches.

:::note
The env-suffix **stripping** behaviour — where `settings.server.cache.dev.json` resolves
to section `server.cache` when env=dev — is specific to `settings*.json` files.

For all other config files, the `<base>.<section>` part still applies: `app.alerts.json`
is merged under `app.alerts`, `app.crons.json` under `app.crons`, and so on. Env-specific
variants of those files (`app.alerts.dev.json`) are handled via the overlay mechanism
described below, not by stripping the suffix from the section key.

## Environment overlays

For every config file `foo.json`, you can create `foo.${env}.json` alongside it.
When the active `NODE_ENV` matches, the env file is loaded **on top of** the base file —
env values win on conflict.

```
src/<bundle>/config/
├── connectors.json         ← base (all envs)
└── connectors.dev.json     ← overlay, active only when NODE_ENV=dev
```

This lets you keep different database hosts for local development without touching
the production config.

:::caution
Files starting with a dot (`.`) are **always skipped** by the framework. Never rely on
dotfiles for configuration the framework needs to read.

## Load order

Config is loaded in two phases on bundle start.

**Phase 1 — Settings** (`settings*.json`)

All `settings*.json` files are collected and merged into a single settings tree.
The section name is extracted from the filename; env-suffixed files only contribute
to their section when `NODE_ENV` matches.

```
settings.json                   → root
settings.server.json            → server
settings.server.credentials.json→ server.credentials
settings.server.cache.dev.json  → server.cache   (dev only)
```

**Phase 2 — Everything else**

For each remaining config file:

1. Load `foo.${env}.json` if it exists (env overlay)
2. Load `foo.json` (base)
3. Merge — env overlay wins on conflict
4. Apply shared config from `shared/config/` if present

**Framework defaults** are merged below user values for three files:

| File | Framework baseline |
|---|---|
| `settings.json` | `core/template/conf/settings.json` — engine, address, upload defaults |
| `statics.json` | `core/template/conf/statics.json` — gina vendor CSS/JS, public root |
| `templates.json` | `core/template/conf/templates.json` — `_common` with layout and gina assets |

Your values always win. The framework baseline only fills in keys you have not declared.

## Path template variables

Values in config files can reference framework-resolved paths using `${variable}` placeholders.
These are substituted at load time.

| Variable | Resolves to |
|---|---|
| `${gina}` | Absolute path to the gina install |
| `${version}` | Active gina version string |
| `${scope}` | Active scope (`local`, `beta`, `production` …) |
| `${rootDomain}` | Root domain of the project (e.g. `example.com`) |
| `${host}` | Hostname of the bundle |
| `${projectVersionMajor}` | Major version of the project |
| `${bundlePath}` | Absolute path to the current bundle |
| `${templatesPath}` | Absolute path to the bundle's templates directory |
| `${publicPath}` | Absolute path to the bundle's public directory |
| `${handlersPath}` | Absolute path to the bundle's handlers directory |
| `${tmpPath}` | Absolute path to the project tmp directory |
| `${cachePath}` | Absolute path to the project cache directory |

## Shared config

Place a config file under `shared/config/` at the project root to make it available
to every bundle. Bundle-level files take precedence over shared files when both exist.

```
myproject/
├── shared/
│   └── config/
│       ├── routing.global.json   ← global middleware for all bundles
│       └── statics.json          ← shared static paths
└── src/
    └── <bundle>/
        └── config/
            └── statics.json      ← takes precedence over shared/config/statics.json
```
